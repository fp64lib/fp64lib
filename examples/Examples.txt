Examples

double vs. float	experience the limited precision of the 
			built-in types float and double
			vs. extended precision of fp64lib

Leibniz Series		One of the most famous ways to calculate
			Pi, created by historic mathematician
			Gottfried Leibniz

Double			Move to a more "natural" way on using
			fp64lib with normal operations like +, -, *, /,
			similar to the built-in types float or double

Julien Date		A base routine, used in astronomy to convert
			date and time into a continous number,
			comparing accuracy with internal data types

rpncalc			Core of an RPN based calculator (like the
			calculators of Hewlet Packard/HP), that can
			easily be extended and can be controlled via
			USB/Serial interface
