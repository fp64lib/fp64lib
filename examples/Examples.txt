Examples

double vs. float	see the limited precision of the 
					built-in types float and double
					vs. extended precision of fp64lib
Leibniz Series		One of the most famous ways to calculate
					Pi, created by historic mathematician
					Gottfried Leibnis
Double				Move to a more "natural" way on using
					fp64lib with normal operations like +, -, *, /,
					similar to the built-in types float or double
Julien Date			A base routine, used in astronomy to convert
					date and time into a continous number,
					comparing accuracy with internal data types
rpncalc				Core of an RPN based calculator (like the
