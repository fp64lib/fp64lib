sentence=Handcrafted 64-bit floating point routines for AVR/arduino microprocessors.
paragraph=fp64lib is a library for implementing 64-bit floating point arithmetic on the AVR MegaAVR architecure microprocessors, like the popular Arduino series. Data format is fully compatible with IEEE 754 binary64 standard. V1.1.16 contains a complete rewrite of fp64_modf to fix a bug and make it fully compatible with C/C++.
